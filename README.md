# This is a 2D Clone of Minecraft written in CPython, Pygame and prim-Zinc

### This is the second minor development version after v0.1 and is a still ongoing development.

_Updates will be released soon after and will try to keep as close to the Official Minecraft updates that will be released soon and prior to this clone._

**All textures obtained through trustworthy sources of Minecraft texture files.**

Upgraded UI system, fixed input hanging, officially runable.
Still buggy and unstable.
